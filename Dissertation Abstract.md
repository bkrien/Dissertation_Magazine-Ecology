## Dissertation Abstract

My dissertation project, “Magazine Ecology: Environmental Information Infrastructures in Nineteenth-Century Periodicals,” is an intellectual and material history that utilizes topic modeling and book studies to trace the evolution of environmental writing in nineteenth-century magazines. Examining periodicals as a form of information infrastructure, I explore the relationship between print and environmental thought during this period, assessing how the materiality of magazines, the content within their pages, and the economic and technical forces that shaped them facilitated the dissemination and preservation of information and ideas about the environment.

Utilizing a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of the content of these magazines and data drawn from the HathiTrust Digital Library, I analyze a corpus of over 2,600 issues of popular magazines including of the Atlantic, Harper’s, Scribner’s Monthly. the Century Magazine, the Overland Monthly, and National Geographic to trace how the periodical publishing industry reflected larger cultural trends in the United States between 1850 and 1908, including industrial development, scientific advancement, and the expansion of outdoor recreation. In doing so, I argue for the importance of periodical publishing and print culture in the development of American environmental consciousness and advance new approaches for utilizing digital models to facilitate large-scale archival research. This project offers new insights into the period’s publishing history, including reassessing the role of industrialization on both the form and the content of magazines and exploring how periodicals facilitated the formation of communities of shared practices, interests, and values throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century.
